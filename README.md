# cosmo-calc
An easy-to-use python calculator that calculates all relevant cosmological parameters for a selected cosmological model. This code was written for the purpose of a tutorship at a cosmology block course at the University of Heidelberg (SS 2019) under supervision from Dr. Annalisa Pillepich.

# Usage

Use the cosmo calculator by calling the function cosmo_calc(z, cosmo_dict) for a given redshift z. cosmo_dict is a dictionary determining the cosmological model in the following form:
`cosmo_dict = {'Omega_m': 0.3, 'Omega_r':1e-4, 'Omega_l':0.7, 'Omega_k':0, 'H0': 72, 'Omega_b': 0.0486, 'sigma8': 0.8,'ns': 1 } #specify cosmological model. `

The code is presented as a jupyter notebook for ease of use.
